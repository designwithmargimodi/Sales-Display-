This project showcases a sheet metal corner shelf, designed as a multi-level storage structure typically used in workshops, packaging stations, retail displays, and industrial utility setups. The model is built entirely using SolidWorks Sheet Metal tools with realistic bend features, flat-pattern development, and manufacturable geometry.

The design features step-form shelving levels supported by vertical side plates and edge-flanged borders to increase rigidity. The triangular side profile optimizes space usage and provides structural support, making the component practical for lightweight part storage or workstation organization.

The model was created using sheet metal commands, incorporating bend allowances, flange connections, and reliefs to ensure proper unfoldability in fabrication.

Key characteristics include:

Multi-stage stepped shelf layout providing storage at two heights

Edge flanges and bends for structural stiffness and formability

Flat-pattern ready geometry suitable for laser cutting and CNC bending

Consistent material thickness and K-factor application for accurate development

Clean design intent that allows parameter editing and resizing

Sheet metal shelves like this are commonly used in production areas, assembly labs, hardware shops, and industrial storage setups. Their open-form structure allows easy access, visibility, and organization of components during work.

This model focuses on real-world manufacturability and sheet metal process understanding, making it well-suited for learning purposes, fabrication practice, or portfolio demonstration in CAD and mechanical design.
